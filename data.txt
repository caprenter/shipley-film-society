Certificate: 15
Saturday 28th October 2017, 7.30pm


*Delicatessen  (Jean-Pierre Jeunet & Marc Caro, France 1992)*


It&rsquo;s hard to imagine what a post-apocalyptic romantic comedy about cannibalism would look like until you see Delicatessen. Ingenious, bizarre, visually stunning and an instant cult classic &ndash; comedy doesn&rsquo;t get much darker than this. 

*"Part macabre horror, part romantic drama, part childlike fable, this ingeniously original French film defies categorization, but is successful on all of these levels, which may explain why it has become an international cult classic."
*Emanuel Levy

*"Increasingly inventive as it progresses, Jeunet and Caro's fast, funny feature debut entertains from sinister start to frantic finish."

A group of Norwegian film students set out to capture real-life trolls on camera after learning their existence has been covered up for years by a government conspiracy. 

A thrilling and wildly entertaining film, Trollhunter delivers truly fantastic images of giant trolls wreaking havoc on the countryside, with darkly funny adherence to the original Norwegian folklore.

*&ldquo;&Oslash;vredal's movie has wittier ideas up its sleeve than the average "mock-doc" shocker, a genre it transcends through sheer originality.&rdquo;
*Daily Telegraph*

&ldquo;A leisurely, shambling, deadpan movie about a man who finds trolls and kills them. That's enough.&rdquo;

A Story of Children and Film

Friday 9th December 2016, 7.30pm

*A Story of Children and Film (Mark Cousins, UK, 2013)


Laura and Ben play in an Edinburgh room. At first they are shy, then they get stroppy, then show off, then tell stories, then wreck the toy that they're playing with. 

While they stay in their room,* A Story of Children and Film travels the world. It&rsquo;s a journey through world cinema, in which we see how great films from 25 countries - classics and rarities - have depicted shyness, stropiness, storytelling, adventure, surrealism, doggedness  and violence in childhood. 

*&ldquo;Mark Cousins's personal cine-essay about children on film is entirely distinctive, sometimes eccentric, always brilliant: a mosaic of clips, images and moments chosen with flair and grace, both from familiar sources and from the neglected riches of cinema around the world.&rdquo;
*The Guardian

*&ldquo;Something about Mark Cousins's feyly magisterial presenting style fits the material like a glove in his new documentary - it may be the best thing he's ever done.&rdquo;
*Daily Telegragh

*&ldquo;At the very least, you'll walk away from A Story of Children and Film with an additional 50 or so movies to add to your watch list.&rdquo;

*"There are many tonal plates being spun here; the lack of a deafening crash is impressive. It comes down, you suspect, to the film's embrace of its own contradictions."

*"The mood shifts constantly, so that at any given moment the family's lifestyle seems either ideal or like a mild form of child abuse."

Given the subject matter, this is a surprisingly enjoyable and provocative blend of thriller, comedy and satire as it follows two bungling rural cops in their frustrated attempts to track down a brutal serial killer. 

*"How the hell does a film this tonally out there, with characters this lunkheaded and at times even cruel and hateful, manage to be so indescribably moving?"

*"Low-key, unassuming, and crafty in the way it slowly gets under your skin, Memories of Murder is a sly and smart thriller."

The Act of Killing
Certificate: 15
Friday 10th February 2017, 7.30pm


*The Act of Killing (Joshua Oppenheimer & Christine Cynn, Indonesia, 2012)*


*"All murderers are punished, unless they kill in large numbers, and to the sound of trumpets.&rdquo; The film&rsquo;s opening quote from Voltaire sets the stage for a difficult, surreal and chilling journey into the heart of human darkness.
This unique and disturbing documentary challenges former Indonesian death-squad leaders with a fascination for movies to reenact their mass-killings in whichever cinematic genres they wish, including classic crime scenes and lavish musical numbers.
"It was as if we were killing&hellip; happily," says Anwar Congo as the filming progresses. It is undeniably a difficult film to watch, but one which we owe to ourselves and those who have lived through or who are still facing such horror.

*&ldquo;Oppenheimer demonstrates how easily the passive spectator can become an unlikely abettor, and the great cause of his film is to make his actors and audience recognize their moral culpability.&rdquo;
*Boston Pheonix

&ldquo;The Act of Killing works brilliantly on many levels, capturing like no other documentary I have seen, like no other film I can imagine, the fevered insanity of those days.&rdquo;
*The Australian

*&ldquo;Unspeakable horror and utterly mundane madness are thrown together in the existential equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider - fact and fiction meeting head on with quietly earth-shattering results.&rdquo;
*The Observer

*&ldquo;It is a gut-churning film: and a radical dive into history, grabbing the past in a way a conventional documentary would not.&rdquo;

 *Nae Pasaran (Felipe Bustros Sierra, UK 2018)

1974, Scotland. Bob Fulton, a Rolls-Royce engine inspector, returns to his section, upset and anxious. He's just told his colleagues that a Chilean Air Force jet engine has arrived in the factory for maintenance and he's refusing to let it go through, in protest against the recent military coup of General Pinochet. 

He's seen the images of people packed into football stadiums and the Chilean Air Force jets bombing Santiago, and now one of the engines from those very same planes is right there, waiting for inspection. He can see his supervisors approaching, he knows he's about to be fired yet he feels a responsibility&hellip;

"The film explores this modest act of rebellion in an admirably low-key way that emphasises the fundamental decency of the men who took a stand."
The Scotsman

*"Modest, eloquent, informed and funny, the four are dream interviewees, able to recall in painstaking detail the events of the time."

*Night on Earth, J. Jarmusch, 1991

Five entirely different cab rides in five locations around the world unfold simultaneously. Each ride is fraught with high drama, each one evoking a mood of time and place.

*Though it may take a while to get Jarmusch's gist, hang in there; by the time Tom Waits growls his lovely closing waltz over the credits, Jarmusch has shown us moments most filmmakers don't even notice.
Time Out

Revisiting his interest in oblique comedy, Jarmusch explores a primal relationship, that of a passenger and taxi driver, using the cab as a temporary shared world, from which one party may emerge shaken up or feeling differently about himself/herself

*Dig! (Ondi Timoner, US, 2003)


Whether or not you&rsquo;ve heard of the bands *The Brian Jonestown Massacre or the *The Dandy Warhols really misses the point of this remarkable film, and for a music documentary, there isn&rsquo;t even all that much music. 

Filmed over seven years, *Dig! is an essay on the tortuous relationship between people who perceive themselves as artistic geniuses and pretty much everyone else. 

This is a rollercoaster ride, taking us down a fine line between authenticity and pretentiousness, global success and near total self-destruction.

*&ldquo;It's a classic music soap opera, but never told with a more raw scream for help at its centre.&rdquo;
*Orlando Sentinal

&ldquo;In a year that has seen several fascinating documentaries on famous rock stars and their problems, Dig! stands out for being about musicians who only think they should be famous. And, man, do they have problems.&rdquo;

A perfect Swedish family &mdash; handsome businessman Tomas, his willowy wife Ebba and their two blond, pre-teen children &mdash; are on a skiing holiday in the French Alps. The sun is shining and the slopes are spectacular but, during lunch at a mountainside restaurant, suddenly events turn everything upside down. As Ebba tries to protect her children, Tomas makes a decision that will shake the family's world to its core.

*"This is slender material to build a whole film around, but &Ouml;stlund turns it into something deep."

*"Force Majeure" leaves the audience squirming - in all the very best ways.."

*Schubert's performance is so eloquent and Markovics's direction so sure that the film blazes with an extraordinary power.
Time Out

Markovics's script circles around the themes of death and life in thoughtful and elegant ways: it is a well-carpentered screenplay which bears every sign of having been a labour of love, worked on fruitfully over many years.

K&ouml;tting sets off on a journey with friends, including historian Iain Sinclair and writer Alan Moore. Starting at Waltham Abbey they make their way to St Leonards-on-Sea exploring the tales of King Harold and his secular wife Edith Swan-Neck.

*"There&rsquo;s something uniquely wonderful about the unfettered pagan spirit of Andrew K&ouml;tting. His film-making has an anarchic lawlessness; a refreshing alternative to pictures that are pruned and shaped to fit into a preordained structure."

*"This zero-to-no-budget piece is something like a filmed moment of street theatre or Pythonesque subversion of the English past. It is a kind of occult dress-up pilgrimage, tracing in reverse an imaginary journey&hellip;"

Jojo is living in an uneasy relationship with his father as they both struggle to cope with his mother's absence. The father's dark moods and inclination to drink creates a seemingly unbearable situation, but with a child's resilience Jojo finds emotional escape routes. He loves to listen to the music his mother recorded, to tell stories and to run around in the wasteland behind his house where he finds an abandoned young bird ('Kauw' in Dutch), and a new purpose in life.

*"Moving and joyous Kauwboy is a short but perfectly formed film that stands out as an honest portrayal of growing up and dealing with loss and sorrow."
Flickfeast

*"Obviously, in a film about a boy and a bird, there is no escaping comparisons to Ken Loach's classic Kes (1969), but it's a film that manages to stand on its own"

*Asunder (Esther Johnso*,* UK, 2016)*


A film by Esther Johnson and narrated by Kate Adie and Alun Armstrong, 'Asunder' tells the story of what happened to a quintessential British town during the First World War, with virtually all of its men abroad fighting and its women and children left behind.

The North East was in the front line, thanks to its shipyards and munitions factories. Using archive and contemporary footage and audio, this documentary reveals the stories of people from Tyneside and Wearside and uncovers just what life was like on the home front - with bombs falling on Britain for the first time, conscientious objectors sentenced to death, and women working as doctors and tram conductors.

What the future demands, however, is the overthrow of the very establishment, archaic rituals and creeping corruption that created him.Shot just before the student riots in Paris of May 1968,*If... embodies the anti-authoritarian spirit of the age, and nearly 50 years on finds a new audience as the establishment is once again questioned by a disillusioned generation.

An award winning documentary that gives a unique insight into one of History's most dramatic events: the 1984-85 British Miners' Strike. No experts. No Politicians. 

Thirty years on, this is the raw emotional story of those who drove Britain's longest strike. The film weaves stunningly edited archive footage of the strike and never before seen interviews with the real key players of the strike: the miners themselves, accompanied by a soulful, timely soundtrack. 

It is ultimately a universal tale of ordinary people standing up for what they believe in. It challenges us to look again at our past so that in the words of one miner 'we can still seek to do something about the future'.

*&ldquo;This is timely, important and truthful cinema, at once bitter, nostalgic and unexpectedly uplifting.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Gower's film is a heartfelt tribute to the communities who were hammered by political, not economic, forces. They look bloodied, but unbowed.&rdquo;

Catch Me Daddy is at times very bleak, &ldquo;a despairing howl at the state of contemporary Britain&rdquo; as one critic put it. Or as some well-known Bradford graffiti used to say &hellip;it&rsquo;s a mean old scene.

Conformists who were once rebels and radicals who've ended up as reactionaries is the theme of *The Edukators, the second feature by the Austrian neurologist-turned-film-maker Hans Weingartner, made entirely with handheld cameras and natural light.

Jan and Peter have a hidden life as a duo calling themselves The Edukators. Breaking into expensive homes, they rearrange the furniture and leave messages for the wealthy owners. Peter's girlfriend Jule comes between them and a job goes horribly wrong, leaving the three of them stuck with an unexpected hostage in the form of a lapsed sixties radical.

*"The Edukators makes clear that everyone plays by rules they didn't make, then excuses themselves for not changing the world."
*PopMatters

*"The whole thing feels messy, painful, funny and believable, just like that hideous circus known as real life."
*Washington Post

After threatening to end a factory slowdown by murdering hundreds of Czech workers, a Nazi tyrant is shot. 

The desperate killer, a member of a Czech resistance group, narrowly escapes capture. As he tries to elude the Gestapo he struggles with his impulse to give himself up as Nazi hostages are executed.

*&ldquo;From a directorial standpoint this is a triumph for Fritz Lang, who succeeds with singular success in capturing the spirit of the Czech people in the face of the Nazi reign of terror.&rdquo;
*Variety*

&ldquo;Superb performances throughout, while James Wong Howe's photography perfectly captures the spirit of the occupied city, where hiding places are few and far from safe.&rdquo;

Dheepan
Certificate: 18
Saturday 28th April 2018, 7.30pm

 *Dheepan (Jaques Audiard, France 2015)

*Dheepan is a gripping, human tale of survival. On the losing side of a civil war in Sri Lanka, a Tamil soldier poses as the husband and father of two other refugees in order to escape their ravaged homeland. Arriving in France, the makeshift "family" sets about establishing a new life-only to find themselves once again embroiled in violence on the mean streets of Paris.

A heartrending saga of three strangers united by circumstance and struggle, *Dheepan is both a tour-de-force thriller and a powerful depiction of the immigrant experience.
*Dheepan was &nbsp;winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival for acclaimed director Jacques Audiard *(A Prophet).

*"Like the best fiction, it takes the most incomprehensible stories of our time and makes them hauntingly, inescapably clear."
Washington Post

*"The film simmers and builds until it boils over in an explosive climax. And it shows how far people will go just to be able to cling to some semblance of hope."
Detroit News

*"Audiard humanizes his characters in such a way that it's easy to forget you're watching a film and not a documentary subject."

Two brothers are taken by a father they only knew from a single photograph on a journey into the wilderness. Tantalizing ambiguity turns into an urgent mystery. 

*&ldquo;Zvyagintsev gets formidable concentration from his youthful actors, and his storytelling moves with the simplicity -- calm, chiselled, and suggestive -- of a fable.&rdquo;
New Yorker

&ldquo;Constructed like an eerie, metaphorical thriller, this tense, riveting character study offers viewers nearly two hours of emotions with a stunning pay-off no one will be expecting.&rdquo;

The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner

DATE CHANGE: Friday 2 November 2018, 7.30pm

*The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner (Tony Richardson, UK 1962)

In this classic of British New Wave cinema, teenager Colin Smith is sent to a borstal after a robbery. His talent for cross country running are spotted by the Governor who sees sport as a cure for social ills, but in this gritty tale of rebellion and conformity, life's rewards seldom reach the working class.

*"Ultimately, Richardson's pot-shots at consumerism and class have lost some urgency, but the nihilistic, punky buzz packs an immortal wallop. Classic."
Total Film

*"The counter-Hollywood bloody-mindedness packs a knockout punch."

Friday 15th February 2019, 7.30pm

*Liberation Day (Ugis Olte & Morten Traavik, Latvia/North Korea, 2016)

Ex-Yugoslavian cult band Laibach become the first foreign rock group ever to perform in the fortress state of North Korea. Confronting strict ideology and cultural differences, the band struggles to get their songs through the needle's eye of censorship before they can be unleashed on an audience never before exposed to alternative rock'n'roll. 

Meanwhile, propaganda loudspeakers are being set up at the border between the two Koreas and a countdown to war is announced. The hills are alive...with the sound of music.


*"Most documentaries or studies of North Korea conclude that it is forever sealed in its own tyranny. For all the absurdity, for all the questionable semi-satire, Laibach actually made contact with North Korea and caused a crack in the wall."<span style="font-size:16px; color:#262626;">
The Guardian

*"There's a subtly meaningful power to what the film actually does: witnessing the awkwardness that ensues when the creatively free try to communicate with people who lack the context to understand unfettered expression."
Los Angeles Times

*"Whatever labyrinthine justifications stand behind it, Liberation Day is the kind of film that might never be made again, so I can safely say that you'll never see anything quite like it."

Emanual Levy


&ldquo;Set just as Stalin was launching the great purges, Burnt by the Sun is about the moment when Russian Communism passed from idealism into nightmare.&rdquo;

Nineteen year old French Arab Malik is just starting a six year sentence &ndash; his first in adult prison. With no friends inside, he just hopes to serve his sentence in peace. He is soon recruited by the head of the Corsican inmates, not only transforming his experience inside the prison but setting the scene for his continued life of crime outside.

*&ldquo;Audiard also revives the hidden source of our &shy;fascination with prisons. They are places of violence and fear, but also of &shy;paradoxical freedom &ndash; freedom from the ties of outside lives. They are places you can remake yourself, for good or ill, &shy;hellish furnaces in which you can smelt a new identity.&rdquo;

 _43874387 The Lobster
Certificate: 15
Friday 9th September 2016, 7.30pm
 

 *The Lobster (Yorgos Lanthimo*,* UK, 2016)*

Imagine a Britain where outwardly everything remains the same, except that any widely held prejudice becomes public policy. It&rsquo;s a society where, for example, if you&rsquo;re single person you are not just made to feel a failure, you&rsquo;ve become unacceptable. 

For divorcees like David, it means a trip to an isolated English resort and just 45 days to find a new mate, with bizarre consequences for failure. 

What follows is an award winning mix of black comedy, romance and thriller which explores a UK where a politely spoken, outwardly eccentric, tweed wearing fascism has found mainstream acceptability, and where an animal loving public accepts bizarre and surreal new truths rather than face the nightmarish reality of their own making*
*The film is sort of allegorical, sort of science fiction, sort of philosophical, definitely original, definitely unpredictable and most definitely weird.
*MLive.co*

A wild, sad, mordantly funny dystopia that gives sexual desperation the bad name it deserves.
*The Wra*

Farrell makes a convincing sad sack regaining his romantic pulse. Weisz is radiant as, depending on how you see her character, a triumphant or a tragic heroine. Take a chance and go with this one.

*Hodegerne (Headhunters) (Morten Tyldum, Norway, 2011)


Roger Brown is a corporate recruiter. He&rsquo;s not exactly handsome, and with insecurities about his below average height, he moonlights as an art thief to pay for pay a lavish lifestyle, complete with big house and beautiful wife. When he decides to go for &ldquo;the big one&rdquo; and solve his financial problems once and for all, things go terribly wrong and rapidly spiral out of control.

Although not for the squeamish, it&rsquo;s a fast paced cinematic ride that puts its Hollywood counterparts to shame.

*&ldquo;Headhunters is an exhilarating thriller with great visual flare, top notch acting, and a story that will have you so involved that you'll possibly have no fingernails by the end of it!&rdquo;
*Sin Magazine

Whatever the cinematic equivalent of a kick in the pants might be, you'll find it at Headhunters.
