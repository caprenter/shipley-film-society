Premiering on a chilly February evening in 2010 with Ken Loach's fabulous Looking for Eric,Shipley Film Society was the first regular cultural event at a reinvented and reinvigorated Kirkgate Centre in Shipley.

Now part of a vibrant programme at the centre, which includes the likes of the Front Room Disco and [Golden Cabinet](https://www.facebook.com/goldencabinetuk) we'd like to think Shipley Film Society is, in its own small way, part of what makes Shipley a really great place to live.

You can find out more information about all the different groups and events at the [Kirkgate Centre Website](http://www.kirkgatecentre.org.uk)
