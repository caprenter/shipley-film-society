Premiering on a chilly February evening in 2010 with Ken Loach's fabulous Looking for Eric,Shipley Film Society was the first regular cultural event at a reinvented and reinvigorated Kirkgate Centre in Shipley.

Now part of a vibrant programme at the centre, which includes the likes of the Front Room Disco and [Golden Cabinet](https://www.facebook.com/goldencabinetuk) we'd like to think Shipley Film Society is, in its own small way, part of what makes Shipley a really great place to live.

You can find out more information about all the different groups and events at the [Kirkgate Centre Website](http://www.kirkgatecentre.org.uk)
        
All our films are still shown at the [Kirkgate Centre ](http://www.kirkgatecentre.org.uk), situated in the centre of Shipley and opposite the town hall. The full address is:

Kirkgate Centre  
39a Kirkgate  
Shipley  
BD18 3EH  

A bar is open before films, serving wines, beers and non-alcoholic drinks, popcorn and cake.

## Are you sitting comfortably?

We love the Kirkgate Centre and we'd especially love to see it re-furbished! Until that happens, it can get a little cool in the winter, so bring along a cushion and blanket if you like!

## Bradford Metropolitan Foodbank

We ask everyone who comes to look though your cupboards and bring along some non-perishable food for distribution to those struggling to feed themselves or their family. We really look forward to the day when this is no longer necessary.

## Get involved

The film society is run entirely by volunteers. Please drop us line or chat to us after a film if you'd like to get more involved. Membership is simple and free - just join our mailing list!
