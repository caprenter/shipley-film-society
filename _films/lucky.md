description: 'LUCKY follows the spiritual journey of a 90-year-old atheist and the
  quirky characters that inhabit his off the map desert town. Having out lived and
  out smoked all of his contemporaries, the fiercely independent Lucky finds himself
  at the precipice of life, thrust into a journey of self exploration, leading towards
  that which is so often unattainable: enlightenment. Acclaimed character actor John
  Carroll Lynch''s directorial debut, "Lucky", is at once a love letter to the life
  and career of Harry Dean Stanton as well as a meditation on mortality, loneliness,
  spirituality, and human connection.'
