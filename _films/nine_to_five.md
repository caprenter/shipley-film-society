short-description: Three female employees of a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical
  bigot find a way to turn the tables on him.
description: Meet Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman). The biggest "sexist, egotistical,
  lying, hypocritical bigot" boss on the planet. He thrills in taking advantage of
  his head female office staff; humiliating, downplaying, and condescending against
  them whenever conveniently possible, particularly his top assistant Violet (Lily
  Tomlin). Long-exhausted over his gruesome bullishness, Violet, alongside co-workers
  Doralee (Dolly Parton) and Judy (Jane Fonda) comprise comical methods of "doing
  him in", when a freak incident occurs.
