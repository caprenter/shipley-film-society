short-description: 
description: "Nineteen year old French Arab Malik is just starting a six year sentence
  – his first in adult prison. With no friends inside, he just hopes to serve his
  sentence in peace. He is soon recruited by the head of the Corsican inmates, not
  only transforming his experience inside the prison but setting the scene for his
  continued life of crime outside. \n\n> *Audiard also revives the hidden source of
  our ­fascination with prisons. They are places of violence and fear, but also of
  ­paradoxical freedom – freedom from the ties of outside lives. They are places you
  can remake yourself, for good or ill, ­hellish furnaces in which you can smelt a
  new identity.* - The Guardian\n\nA bar will be open serving wines, beers, soft drinks
  and cake."
